# NSC EVENTS Fullstack - PostgreSQL Migration

This is a frontend (Next.js) application for NSC EVENTS, fully migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.

## Project Structure

- `nsc-events-nextjs`: Frontend application built with Next.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm
- PostgreSQL 14 or higher
- pgAdmin

### Installation

To get started, you can use the automated setup script for your operating system.

#### For macOS and Linux users:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SeattleColleges/nsc-events-fullstack
cd nsc-events-fullstack

# Run the setup script
bash setup-macos-linux.sh
or ./setup-macos-linux.sh
```

#### For Windows users:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SeattleColleges/nsc-events-fullstack
cd nsc-events-fullstack

# Run the setup script
./setup-windows.bat
```

After running the script, you will need to:

1.  **Create a PostgreSQL database** named `nsc_events`.

Alternatively, you can follow the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SeattleColleges/nsc-events-fullstack
cd nsc-events-fullstack

# Install PostgreSQL and remember your password

# Set up the frontend
cd ../nsc-events-nextjs
cp .env.example .env.local
# Update .env.local if needed
npm install
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `nsc_events`
3. The database tables will be automatically created when you start the backend

### Running the Applications

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd nsc-events-nextjs
npm run dev
```

### Building

```bash
# Build both applications
npm run build

# Build only frontend
npm run build:frontend

```

### Testing

```bash
# Test both applications
npm run test

# Test only frontend
npm run test:frontend

# Test only backend
npm run test:backend

# Run E2E tests (requires both services running)
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with interactive UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

For more details on E2E testing, see [e2e/README.md](./e2e/README.md).
